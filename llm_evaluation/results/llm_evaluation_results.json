    "baseline_answer": "The text does not specifically mention the main characteristics of traditional Japanese arts. However, it can be inferred that traditional Japanese culture has been shaped by centuries of selective absorption and adaptation of foreign influences, resulting in a unique blend of indigenous patterns and external cultural values.\n\nIt is mentioned that Buddhist deities were adopted into the Shint\u014d pantheon, which suggests that traditional Japanese spirituality and mythology have incorporated elements from Buddhism and other foreign sources. Similarly, the text notes that Chinese writing systems, urban design, and other cultural developments have been introduced to Japan but modified over time to fit indigenous patterns.\n\nIf we look at the introduction of Western influences, it is mentioned that Western or Westernized music has become more common in many social settings, while traditional Japanese music is not as prevalent. Additionally, the use of Western dress and architectural forms have replaced traditional styles, such as the kimono and traditional houses made of natural materials.\n\nTherefore, it can be inferred that traditional Japanese arts may still reflect indigenous patterns and cultural values, but have also been influenced by centuries of external cultural exchange and adaptation.",
