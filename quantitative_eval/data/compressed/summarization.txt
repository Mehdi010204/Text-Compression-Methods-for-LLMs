In the 19th and 20th century, Japan began to adapt its culture to the Western world. The use of Western dress among the Japanese, in place of the traditional kimono, long ago became commonplace. ternized music generally is more common than traditional Japanese music in many social settings. Although Japanese Christians form a tiny percentage of the population, Christmas (or the outer trappings of it) is widely observed, almost as a folk event.
