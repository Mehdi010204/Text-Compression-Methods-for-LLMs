It is common for Western observers of contemporary Japan to emphasize its great economic achievement without equal regard to cultural attributes. Chinese writing and many other Chinese developments were introduced in the early centuries ce; the writing system underwent many modifications over the centuries, since it did not fit the Japanese language. Western cultural traits were introduced on a large scale through the schools and the mass communication media. Western scientific and technical terms have been widely diffused in translation and have even been reexported to China and Korea. American and European influences on Japanese culture are in evidence in literature, the visual arts, music, education, science, recreation, and ideology.

Modernization was accompanied by cultural changes. Rationalism and socialism based on Christianity, as well as Marxism, became inseparably related to everyday Japanese life. House construction also was changed considerably by the introduction of Western architectural forms and functions.
